# MyGenWashy
Generic washing Machine Controller - Result of the TuttleButtle Hackathon 2025
held 13.-15.6.2025 in Vienna Austria.

the team got a broken washing machine and set the task to create a generic open source washing machine controler.
the original washing machine and its electronics and a chinese replacement board were partly reverse engineered to understand the functionality.
the team tested their theories on how safety mechanisms and machine parts worked and had to be controlled.
At the end of day two the machine was running a cold wash programm from a dev kit and some homemade electronics controlled via ESP-home.
On day three the learnings and circuits were converted into a kicad design for further testing and software development.

the board is intended to be locally produceable, by hand soldering and easy to repair. We avoided  "special" components for easy component substitution.
